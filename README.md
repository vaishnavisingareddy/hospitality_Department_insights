# hospitality_Department_insights
This is my project in which I used raw data and produced results which shows the best strategic results which can be used by stake holders for better revenue. 
I've extracted the raw data which is needed for my analysis from codebasics.
for completing this project I first started with cleaning the data which includes removing wrong data, duplicate data and worked to solve the issue of missing data and then started with analyising the data. I have worked to answer few important questions which could lead to betterment of the organization.
Then I've used Power BI to make the best possible dashboards which I can present to the organisation. 
And then finally concluded with Canva for final touch(appearance).
